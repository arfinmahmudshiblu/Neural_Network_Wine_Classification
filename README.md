# Which architecture performed best? Why?
Architecture C is providing a best accuracy. So I can conclude that "Architecture C is best. 
Architecture C is the one that balanced complexity and generalization — enough hidden neurons
to learn patterns, but not so many that it overfit the training data.
# How did learning rate affect training?
The learning rate determines the step size of model parameter updates during training, 
affecting its speed and stability. A high learning rate can cause instability and 
overshooting the optimal solution, leading to poor performance, while a low learning 
rate results in slow convergence, potentially getting stuck in a local minimum. The 
right learning rate is crucial for efficient and effective training.
# What is the impact of adding more neurons?
Adding more neurons increases the model’s ability to learn complex data,but beyond a 
certain point it can cause overfitting and longer training without better results.
# Which activation function would you try next?
Definitely, I try Leaky ReLU or ELU — they improve learning stability and prevent dead 
neurons, often giving smoother and faster convergence.

Experiment with Model C is provided highest accuracy for individual learning rate than Experiment with Model A, B.
