# Which architecture performed best? Why?
Architecture C is providing a best accuracy. So I can conclude that "Architecture C is best. 
Architecture C is the one that balanced complexity and generalization — enough hidden neurons
to learn patterns, but not so many that it overfit the training data.
# How did learning rate affect training?
The learning rate determines the step size of model parameter updates during training, 
affecting its speed and stability. A high learning rate can cause instability and 
overshooting the optimal solution, leading to poor performance, while a low learning 
rate results in slow convergence, potentially getting stuck in a local minimum. The 
right learning rate is crucial for efficient and effective training.
